## About me


:floppy_disk:   I have approached coding to change my career from teaching in primary school. Thanks to free online great courses like **Harvard's CS50** and **FreeCodeCamp**, I have learnt the basics of Computer Science and coding.
<br/>
<br/>

:sparkles:   I have recently graduated from **CodeFirstGirls degree +Masters**, where I have consolidated my foundation in `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and developed more advanced software engineering concepts using `Python` and `Java`. Using full-stack frameworks like `Flask` and `Spring Boot`, I have learnt to develop and integrate `APIs` to perform CRUD operations on a `MySQL` database and talk to the user interface. I have used `Docker` to build containers and deploy the finished applications.

<br/>

:soon:   Portfolio website coming soon...
<br/>
<br/>

ðŸŒ±   Iâ€™m currently focusing on adding a `Thymeleaf` front-end to the latest `Spring Boot` projects. My dream is to become a Tech Entrepeneur and develop software to support neurodiverse fellow brains.
<br/>
<br/>


âš¡   Fun fact: I tried coding for the first time thanks to my class students (I used to be a primary teacher).
