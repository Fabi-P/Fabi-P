## About me


:floppy_disk:   I have approached coding to change my career from teaching in primary school. Thanks to free online great courses like **Harvard's CS50** and **FreeCodeCamp**, I have learnt the basics of Computer Science and coding.
<br/>
<br/>

:sparkles:   I have recently graduated from **CodeFirstGirls degree**, where I have consolidated my foundation in `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and developed more advanced software engineering concepts using `Python`.
<br/>
<br/>

:soon:   Next, I will be attending the CodeFirstGirls Masters to deep my toes into `Java`.
<br/>
<br/>

ðŸŒ±   Iâ€™m currently learning `React` and Machine Learning basic concepts. My dream is to become a Tech Entrepeneur and develop software to support neurodiverse fellow brains.
<br/>
<br/>


âš¡   Fun fact: I tried coding for the first time thanks to my class students (I used to be a primary teacher).
